Selenium: will not accept class with space compound classes cannot be accepted error will come.
id should not be alphanumeric.
confirm link text with anchor a then only go ahead'
when xpath starts with html dont rely





//button[@name='login']

//input[@type='search']

//div/div/div/center/input

//*[text()='Gmail']-
$x("//form/div/div/div/div/div/input")-syntax while searching in chrome
Sx//div/input']")

Following Sibling-we can move to next sibling as well using xpath
//*[@attribute='value']/following-sibling::li[2]------>LI is the sibling number is it 1 2 or 3
we can also traverse back to parent by using childxpath
//*[@attribute='value']/parent::li[2]------>LI is the sibling number is it 1 2 or 3

how to identyfy elemet using text
relative is always preferrable

CSS is 10 times faster than xpath
Syntax
tagname[attribute='value']

[attribute='value']----->this is also fine without tagname
#id will also works for CSS.
.classname is also works for css. if there is a space in classname then it should be replaced with dot.
